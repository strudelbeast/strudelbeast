### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Florian and just graduated the department for informatics at the [HTL St. PÃ¶lten](https://www.htlstp.ac.at/abteilungen/informatik) (it's a higher vocational college) with focus on software engeneering with Java, Databases, network engineering and project management. Besides that we learn the basics of cybersecurity and machine learning.

### Programming
While I was a student I started to learn Python and React and during my internships I worked with Vue.js, Laravel and Openlayers.

With this knowledge, I develop small applications in my spare time, of which unfortunately only a few are actually finished, as I have so many ideas and still have to learn a lot on the side for many of them.

### Hobbies

In my free time, I spend a lot of time at the volunteer fire brigade and have also been working there as an IT executive since 2021.

I also enjoy playing spikeball and beach volleyball or riding my mountain bike.

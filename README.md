## Hi there 👋

I'm Florian (also called strudel by friends).

I work passionately as a Software Engineer and Product Owner ([@strudel-dt](https://github.com/strudel-dt)) at [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/) in the Real User Monitoring Area. There, I'm responsible for working on the UI, that shows the captured RUM data.

Background:
* 2021 I graduated from the department for informatics at the [HTL St. Pölten](https://www.htlstp.ac.at/abteilungen/informatik) (it's a higher vocational college)
  * focus on software engineering with Java, Databases, network engineering and project management. Besides that we learned the basics of cybersecurity and machine learning.
* While I was at school, I started to learn Python, React and during my internships I worked with Vue.js, Laravel and Openlayers.

With this knowledge and if I find time, I develop small applications.

### Hobbies

In my free time, I spend a lot of time at the volunteer fire brigade and work there as an IT executive since 2021. With that I also developed the [LEA Infoscreen](https://lea-app.at/), which is an informational screen application that volunteer fire brigades see when they arrive in the fire brigade to get the most relevant incident information.

I also enjoy playing spikeball and beach volleyball or riding my longboard and mountain bike.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Florian and in 2021 I graduated the department for informatics at the [HTL St. PÃ¶lten](https://www.htlstp.ac.at/abteilungen/informatik) (it's a higher vocational college) with focus on software engeneering with Java, Databases, network engineering and project management. Besides that we learn the basics of cybersecurity and machine learning.
After my civil service I joined [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/), where I work as a fullstack software engineer.

### Programming
While I was a student I started to learn Python and React and during my internships I worked with Vue.js, Laravel and Openlayers.

With this knowledge, I develop small applications in my spare time, of which unfortunately only a few are actually finished, as I have so many ideas and still have to learn a lot on the side for many of them.

### Hobbies

In my free time, I spend a lot of time at the volunteer fire brigade and work there as an IT executive since 2021.

I also enjoy playing spikeball and beach volleyball or riding my longboard and mountain bike.
